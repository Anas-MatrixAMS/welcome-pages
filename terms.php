                                    <p>2.1. On the trivago website, you have the ability to compare third party services via the trivago system.</p>
									<p>2.2. In addition, for some hotels, users have the possibility of booking the selected hotel through a direct connection to the hotel booking sites (third parties) (‘trivago Express Booking’).</p>
									<p>As a result, the booking will be made directly on the hotel booking site and not on the trivago sites. In such cases, trivago is not the travel operator or the contractual party for the user, but only an agent providing the technical connection to the hotel booking site of a third party.</p>
									<p>By making a booking on the website of the third party, users agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of that booking site. These terms and conditions can be viewed on the website of the third party.</p>
									
									<p>Once a booking is made on the website of a third party, a contract is concluded between the booking site and the user, and therefore no contract is concluded between the user and trivago.</p>
									<p>trivago is no contractual party to the hotel booking and all and any claims of the user under the hotel reservation are to be asserted against the third party (the booking site) and not against trivago.</p>
									<p>2.3. This agreement is not affected by any other agreements between the hotel and users.</p>
